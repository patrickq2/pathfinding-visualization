# Maze-Solver
Finds shortest path in a 2d maze


To place and unplace walls left click on any tile and hit 's' to swtich between placing walls and the end and starting points. while placing start and end points left click will place the starting point and right clicking will place end point.

Once points are set and the walls have been configured, you can switch between solving using A*, Dijkstra's, and BFS by hitting 'a', 'd', and 'b' respectively. If you would like to reset the map just hit the space bar to start over.
